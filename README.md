# graphical-implementation-on-page-replacement-algorithm
# In this project, we created a Graphics animation to demonstrate Page Replacement Algorithms. In this algorithm, there are 2 types. The first one is FIFO(first in first out) algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal. the second one is LRU(least recently used) algorithm is a Greedy algorithm where the page to be replaced is least recently used. Using these algorithms to find page faults, and also to minimize the page faults. We have used input devices like keyboard and mouse to interact with the program and also using the opengl built-in functions
